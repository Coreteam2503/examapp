# Criteria-Based Quiz System - Final Project Documentation

## üéâ Project Completion Summary

**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**  
**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0 - Production Ready  

---

## üìä Project Overview

This project successfully transformed a traditional quiz system into a modern **criteria-based quiz system** that dynamically generates questions based on specified criteria rather than using fixed question sets.

### üéØ Core Achievement
- **Before:** Quizzes had fixed questions manually assigned
- **After:** Quizzes use criteria (domain, subject, difficulty) to dynamically select questions at quiz time
- **Benefit:** Infinite quiz variations, better randomization, easier content management

{
  "domain": "Computer Science",
  "subject": "Python Programming", 
  "difficulty_level": "Easy",
  "source": "Course Materials"
}
```

### API Endpoints
```javascript
// New endpoints
POST /api/quizzes/generate-dynamic     // Create criteria-based quiz
POST /api/quizzes/preview-questions    // Preview questions for criteria
POST /api/quizzes/:id/start-attempt    // Start attempt with dynamic questions
```

### Frontend Components
```javascript
// New React components
<CriteriaBasedQuizForm />        // Quiz creation with criteria
<QuizPreviewModal />             // Question preview functionality
<EnhancedQuizCard />             // Shows criteria vs traditional quizzes
```
