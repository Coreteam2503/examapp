# Performance Requirements

## Response Time Targets

### API Performance Requirements
- Batch question creation: <5 seconds for 100 questions
- Quiz generation: <2 seconds for any criteria
- Question search: <1 second with pagination
- Question count/stats: <500ms

### Database Performance Optimizations
- Composite indexes on (domain, subject, source, difficulty_level)
- Individual indexes on frequently queried fields
- Query result caching for repeated searches
- Connection pooling for concurrent users

### Frontend Performance
- Debounced validation (300ms delay)
- Virtualized lists for large question sets
- Code splitting for quiz generation components
- Lazy loading of example templates

## Scalability Requirements

### Concurrent User Support
- Support 50+ concurrent quiz generators
- Handle 10+ concurrent batch question uploads
- Maintain performance under concurrent load
- Graceful degradation under high load

### Database Scalability
- Efficient pagination for large question banks
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Transaction isolation for batch operations
- Query timeout handling (30 seconds max)

### Memory Management
- Batch processing in chunks for large uploads
- Stream processing for large result sets
- Proper connection cleanup
- Memory leak prevention in long-running processes

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- API response times per endpoint
- Database query execution times
- Memory usage during batch operations
- Concurrent user handling capacity

### Performance Testing
- Load testing for batch operations
- Stress testing for concurrent quiz generation
- Database performance testing with large datasets
- Frontend performance testing with large question banks
