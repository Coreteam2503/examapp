One windy day, Mia’s red hat flew off her head.
“It’s flying to the moon!” she shouted.
Her dog Max barked and chased it down the street.
The hat bounced over a puddle and landed on a cat!
“Meow!” said the cat, wearing it like a crown.
Mia giggled and asked politely, “May I have my hat back?”
The cat gave a royal nod and dropped it in her hands.
