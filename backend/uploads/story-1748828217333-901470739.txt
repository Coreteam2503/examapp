ong ago, in a small village, there lived a kind boy named Ravi. He loved to draw and paint. One day, he found an old paintbrush in the forest. When he dipped the brush in water and painted, the paintings came alive!

Ravi painted a small bird, and it flew away singing. He painted a boat, and it sailed on the river. The villagers were amazed and asked Ravi to paint things for them.

But a greedy man named Mr. Sharma heard about the magical paintbrush. He took it from Ravi and demanded gold and treasures. However, the paintbrush only worked for Ravi. When Mr. Sharma tried to paint, nothing happened!

Seeing Mr. Sharma’s greed, the villagers helped Ravi get the paintbrush back. Ravi promised to use it to help others, not for his own riches. From that day on, Ravi painted wonderful things for everyone, and the village was happy.
