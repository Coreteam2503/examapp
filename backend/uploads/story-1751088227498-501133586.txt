The Cloud That Wanted to Paint

Once upon a time, high up in the sky, lived a small fluffy cloud named Pico. While other clouds loved floating and raining, Pico had a big dream — he wanted to paint the sky.

“But clouds don’t paint,” the big clouds would laugh. “We make rain and shade!”

But Pico didn’t give up. He watched sunsets, learned colors from rainbows, and practiced drawing shapes with his mist.

One morning, the sky was gray and gloomy. The sun couldn’t shine through. “Maybe today’s the day,” Pico thought.

He puffed himself up, spun into the wind, and slowly swirled his mist into colors — orange, pink, purple. The other clouds gasped!

By evening, the whole sky lit up in beautiful shades. Birds chirped. Children pointed. Even the moon peeked out early to admire the sky.

From that day on, Pico became the Sunset Cloud, and every evening, he painted the sky — showing everyone that even little clouds can dream big.

Moral: Don’t let others tell you what you can’t do — even a cloud can become a painter if it tries.
