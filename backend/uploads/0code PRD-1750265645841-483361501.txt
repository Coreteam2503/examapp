1. What Is 0code Gaming?
0code Gaming is an educational game platform where people can practice coding through quick 1-minute games.
Think of it like Duolingo, but instead of learning a language, you're learning how to code.
The platform takes lessons or lecture notes (like Jupyter notebooks) and automatically creates fun, 
short quiz games out of them using AI tools like ChatGPT.

2. What’s the Goal?

To help people:
   Understand coding concepts more easily
   Practice regularly in a fun way
   Get feedback on what they need to improve

3. Who Is This For?
	Students learning programming in school or college
	Self-learners using online courses or bootcamps
	Teachers or content creators who want to turn their lessons into games and track student progress

4. How It Works
📂  Upload Coding Lessons
Teachers or users upload files like:
	Jupyter notebooks (Python coding lessons)
	PDFs or text notes
	(In the future) Screenshots or images with text

🤖  AI Creates Questions Automatically
The system uses AI (like OpenAI/ChatGPT) to:
	Read the files
	Understand the code and content
	Create quiz questions such as:
		“What does this line of code do?”
		“Is this correct?”
		“Put these lines of code in the right order”
	Group questions by topic (like loops, functions, etc.)

5. Game Rules
	Each game lasts 60 seconds
	You get unlimited questions in that time
	You answer as many as possible before the timer ends
	Questions are:
		Multiple choice (e.g., What does this mean?)
		Yes/No or True/False
		Rearranging code
	You get points for correct answers
	At the end, you see your score and feedback

6. Game Features
For Players:
	Play quick, fun quizzes
	See your score at the end
	Get feedback on which topics you’re good or weak at
	Try again to beat your high score

For Admins/Teachers:
	Upload lessons
	Preview and edit auto-generated questions
	Track student performance
	See which topics students struggle with most

                      
					  Development Plan
 First 2 Weeks (MVP – Minimum Viable Product)
✅ Week 1:
Backend (Behind the scenes):
	Set up file upload system (for .ipynb notebooks)
	Extract code and notes from uploaded files
	Use AI to make questions
	Store them in a database

Frontend (What users see):
	Build the game screen with timer and simple question type
	Add a score summary page

Team Tasks:
	Check questions for quality
	Collect test notebooks

✅ Week 2:
Frontend:
	Add more question types (like drag-and-drop)
	Mix questions randomly during the game
	Show feedback based on performance

Backend:
	Add topic tags (e.g., this question is about loops)
	Improve AI question generation

Testing:
	Have 5 real users test the whole thing
	Polish visuals
	Deploy a working demo
					
					
						3-Month Vision
🔍 Game Dashboard
	Leaderboards to compare scores with friends or globally
	Personal performance tracking
	Heatmap showing strong and weak topics
	Streak tracking (how often you practice)

🧑‍🏫 Admin Panel (For Teachers)
	Upload notes in different formats
	Let AI turn content into questions
	Review/edit the questions
	Monitor student or class-level performance

👨‍💻 User Scenarios (Stories)
Learner:
	“I want to quickly test myself on Python functions.”	
	“I want to know where I’m weak so I can improve.”

Teacher:
	“I want to turn my lecture into games automatically.”	
	“I want to know how well my students are learning.”

					
						System Features
Frontend (User Interface):
	Mobile-friendly design
	Login with Google or GitHub
	Live timer, scoring, and feedback
	Charts and graphs showing performance

Backend (Behind the scenes):
	Handle file uploads
	Use AI to read and understand notes
	Create quiz games
	Save users, questions, scores, etc.

						Other Important Details
	Performance: Should load fast and run smoothly
	Security: Must protect user data
	Scalability: Should handle thousands of users
	Accessibility: Easy to use for everyone, including people with disabilities

                         Suggested Technologies
	Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
	Backend: Python (FastAPI or Django), PostgreSQL
	AI Tools: OpenAI (ChatGPT), LangChain, spaCy
	OCR (for text from images): Tesseract (later)
	Storage: AWS, Firebase
	Analytics: Metabase, Plotly, or D3.js

						Future Plans
	1-on-1 coding challenges with friends
	AI tutors to help with weak areas
	Gamification: badges, XP points, streak rewards
