Your responsibilities:
1. Analyze the provided content and extract key concepts, functions, patterns, and logic
2. Generate educational questions that test understanding, not just memorization
3. Create questions at appropriate difficulty levels
4. Ensure questions are technically accurate and pedagogically sound
5. Format responses in valid JSON structure

Guidelines:
- Focus on concepts, logic, best practices, and problem-solving
- Avoid trivial syntax questions unless specifically requested
- Include code snippets in questions when relevant
- Make distractors (wrong answers) plausible but clearly incorrect
- Ensure questions test different cognitive levels (comprehension, application, analysis)`;

    const prompt = `Please analyze the following ${language !== 'auto-detect' ? language : ''} content and generate ${numQuestions} high-quality quiz questions.

CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
\`\`\`
${processedContent}
\`\`\`

REQUIREMENTS:
- Difficulty Level: ${difficulty}
- Number of Questions: ${numQuestions}
- Question Types: ${questionTypes.join(', ')}
- Focus on understanding concepts, not just syntax memorization
- Include relevant code snippets in questions when helpful
- Make sure each question tests different aspects of the content

QUESTION TYPE GUIDELINES:

1. MULTIPLE CHOICE (multiple_choice):
   - Provide 4 options (A, B, C, D)
   - Make distractors plausible but clearly wrong
   - Test conceptual understanding

2. FILL-IN-THE-BLANK (fill_in_the_blank):
   - Use ___BLANK_1___, ___BLANK_2___ etc. for blanks in the question text
   - Provide correctAnswers object with possible answers for each blank
   - Focus on key terms, function names, or critical concepts
   - Include hint if helpful

3. TRUE/FALSE (true_false):
   - Create statements that can be definitively true or false
   - Avoid ambiguous statements
   - Focus on specific facts or concepts

4. DRAG & DROP MATCHING (drag_drop_match):
   - Create pairs of related concepts
   - Provide an array of pairs with 'left' and 'right' properties
   - Focus on definitions, relationships, or associations

5. DRAG & DROP ORDERING (drag_drop_order):
   - Provide items that need to be placed in correct sequence
   - Include the correct order in the correctOrder array
   - Focus on processes, steps, or chronological concepts
