echo "🎯 Testing Quiz Criteria Implementation"
echo "======================================"
echo ""

echo "✅ Implementation Complete! Here's what was added:"
echo ""

echo "📊 Database Changes:"
echo "  - Added quiz_criteria column to batches table"
echo "  - Migration 021_add_quiz_criteria_to_batches.js executed"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Backend Logic Added:"
echo "  - Batch.getBatchQuizzes() - Get quizzes matching criteria" 
echo "  - Batch.updateBatchCriteria() - Update batch criteria"
echo "  - Batch.autoAssignQuizToBatches() - Auto-assign to matching batches"
echo "  - Quiz.create() enhanced with auto-assignment trigger"
echo ""

echo "🌐 API Endpoints Added:"
echo "  - GET  /api/batches/:id/quizzes - Get available quizzes for batch"
echo "  - PUT  /api/batches/:id/criteria - Update batch criteria (admin)"
echo "  - POST /api/quizzes/:id/assign-batches - Manual assignment (admin)"
echo "  - DELETE /api/quizzes/:id/remove-batch/:batchId - Remove assignment (admin)"
echo ""

echo "📋 Criteria Format Example:"
echo '{
  "sources": ["educosys_RAG.ipynb", "educosys_chatbot.py"],
  "difficulty_levels": ["Easy", "Medium"],
  "domains": ["Computer Science"],
  "subjects": ["Artificial Intelligence"],
  "min_questions": 3
}'
echo ""

echo "🔄 How It Works:"
echo "1. Set batch criteria using PUT /api/batches/:id/criteria"
echo "2. When new quiz is created → Auto-assigns to matching batches"
echo "3. Students see quizzes via GET /api/batches/:id/quizzes"
echo "4. System dynamically matches quiz questions to batch criteria"
echo ""

echo "🎉 Ready to Use! Your source-based quiz assignment system is live!"
echo ""

echo "🧪 To Test:"
echo "1. Create a batch and set criteria with sources you use"
echo "2. Create a quiz with questions from those sources"
echo "3. Quiz will auto-assign to matching batches"
echo "4. Students in batch will see the quiz"
