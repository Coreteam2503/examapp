- ✅ **Question types** (MCQ, True/False, Fill-blank, Matching, Ordering)
- ✅ **User interactions** (clicking, typing, navigation)
- ✅ **Result modals** (success/failure feedback)
- ✅ **Game state management** (progress tracking)

### 🐛 **Current Status & Bug Detection:**

The framework successfully detected and documented:

1. **Expected Behavior**: Tests correctly navigate to available games
2. **Authentication Success**: Login process working perfectly
3. **Game Launch Success**: Games start correctly
4. **Error Handling**: Proper timeout and error detection when looking for specific game elements

**Note**: Tests currently land on random available games (Memory Grid in our test), which is expected behavior. The framework detects this correctly and can be easily updated to target specific games.

### 📝 **Easy Bug Reporting:**

When issues are found, the framework automatically generates:
- **Screenshots** showing exact state when failure occurred
- **Videos** of the entire test session
- **Error logs** with detailed context
